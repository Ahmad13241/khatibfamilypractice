As a [primary care physician](../about.html) serving the Bullhead City, Laughlin, and Fort Mohave communities for over two decades, I’ve seen firsthand the profound impact of preventive medicine. A cornerstone of this proactive approach is the annual physical examination. While it may seem like a routine visit, this yearly check-up is one of the most powerful tools we have to protect your long-term health and well-being.

## What is an Annual Physical?
An annual physical is more than just a quick check of your vital signs. It’s a comprehensive assessment of your overall health. It provides a crucial opportunity for us to establish a baseline, identify potential risks, and address any health concerns you may have in a low-stress setting. Think of it as a yearly strategy session for your health.

> "The goal of an annual physical is not just to find problems, but to prevent them from starting in the first place. It's the most important appointment you can make all year."

## Key Components of Your Visit
During your physical at our Bullhead City office, we will typically cover several key areas:
*   **Health History Review:** We’ll discuss any changes in your health, lifestyle, or family history since your last visit.
*   **Vital Signs Check:** This includes blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, and temperature.
*   **Physical Examination:** A head-to-toe check to assess the health of your various body systems.
*   **Preventive Screenings:** Based on your age, gender, and risk factors, we may recommend [preventive screenings](../resources.html#preventive-care) for cholesterol, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. This is a core part of our [chronic disease management](../resources.html#chronic-disease) strategy.
*   **Medication Review:** We'll review all your current medications, including prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, and supplements, to avoid potential interactions.

## Why It's Especially Important in Our Community
Living in the Tri-State area comes with its own unique health considerations, from managing chronic conditions in the desert heat to staying active year-round. Your annual physical is the perfect time to discuss these local factors and create a personalized health plan that works for you. By building a strong, long-term relationship, we can better navigate your healthcare journey together.

Don’t wait for a problem to arise. Be proactive about your health. If you haven’t had a physical in over a year, I encourage you to [schedule one today](../contact.html). It’s an investment in your most valuable asset—your health.
