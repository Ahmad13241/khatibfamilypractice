# Logo.png Specifications

To complete the website update, please upload the Logo.png file to this directory with the following specifications:

## File Requirements:
- File name: Logo.png
- Format: PNG with transparency (if the logo has a transparent background)
- Recommended dimensions: 300-400px width (maintaining aspect ratio)
- File size: Optimize to under 100KB without quality loss

## Optimization Tips:
1. Use image optimization tools like TinyPNG (https://tinypng.com/) or ImageOptim
2. Ensure the logo is crisp and clear at the recommended dimensions
3. Test the logo in both light and dark backgrounds to ensure good visibility

## Implementation:
Once uploaded, the Logo.png file will automatically be displayed on:
1. The hero section of the home page
2. The about practice section of the home page

The website has been updated to reference this file, so uploading the logo is the final step to complete the update.

IMAGE OPTIMIZATION NOTE (ADDED 2025-03-15):
-------------------------------------------
The following newer images are currently quite large and would benefit from optimization:
- outside-office.jpeg (2.6MB)
- reception-room.jpeg (2.5MB)
- examination-office.jpeg (1.8MB)

Recommended optimization steps:
1. Resize to 1200Ã—800px maximum dimensions (maintain aspect ratio)
2. Compress to 80-85% quality JPEG
3. Consider converting to WebP format with fallback for broader browser support
4. Target file size: 200-400KB per image for optimal web performance

This optimization would improve page load times, especially on mobile devices.
