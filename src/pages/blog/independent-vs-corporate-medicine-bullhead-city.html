                    <h1>Why Choosing an Independent Doctor in Bullhead City Matters</h1>

                        style="font-size: 1.25rem; color: var(--color-text-light); max-width: 600px; margin: 1rem auto;">
                        In an era of corporate healthcare mergers, finding a doctor who actually knows your name is
                        becoming a luxury. Here's why independent practice is making a comeback.
                    </p>
                </header>

                <div class="article-body">
                    <p>If you live in Bullhead City, Fort Mohave, or Laughlin, you’ve likely noticed a trend: small
                        medical offices are disappearing, replaced by large corporate clinics and hospital-owned
                        networks. While these big systems promise efficiency, many patients are finding that something
                        vital has been lost in the process: <strong>the relationship.</strong></p>

                    <p>At Khatib Family Practice, we have chosen to remain proudly independent since 1998. Why? Because
                        we believe that your health shouldn't be dictated by a boardroom in another state.</p>

                    <h2>The "15-Minute Medicine" Problem</h2>
                    <p>Corporate clinics often operate on a volume-based model. Providers are frequently pressured to
                        see 25-30 patients a day, leaving them with only 10-15 minutes per visit. This "assembly line"
                        approach forces doctors to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Focus only on the immediate symptom, not the root cause.</li>
                        <li>Rush through explanations.</li>
                        <li>Refer you to specialists for issues that a primary care doctor could handle with more time.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <strong>The Independent Difference:</strong> Dr. Nadim Khatib schedules 30+ minutes for
                        appointments. We don't have quotas. We have patients.
                    </div>

                    <h2>Continuity of Care: Seeing <em>Your</em> Doctor</h2>
                    <p>Have you ever made an appointment to see your doctor, only to be told you'll be seeing a nurse
                        practitioner or a locum tenens (temp) provider instead? In large systems, high turnover rates
                        mean you might see a different face every time you visit.</p>
                    <p>In an independent practice like ours, <strong>Dr. Khatib is your doctor.</strong> He knows your
                        medical history, your family situation, and how you reacted to that medication three years ago.
                        You don't have to repeat your story at every visit because we remember it.</p>

                    <h2>Local Loyalty vs. Corporate Profits</h2>
                    <p>When you visit a corporate clinic, the profits often leave the community, funneled back to
                        headquarters in Phoenix, Dallas, or Nashville. Independent practices are small businesses rooted
                        in the community.</p>
                    <p>We live here. We shop at the same grocery stores in Bullhead City. We care about the health of
                        our neighbors because we <em>are</em> neighbors.</p>

                    <h2>The Verdict: Better Health Outcomes</h2>
                    <p>Studies consistently show that patients with a strong, continuous relationship with a primary
                        care physician have:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lower overall healthcare costs.</li>
                        <li>Fewer hospitalizations.</li>
                        <li>Better management of chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension.</li>
                        <li>Higher satisfaction with their care.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If you are tired of feeling like a number in a database, it might be time to switch back to
                        private practice.</p>
